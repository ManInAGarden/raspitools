Raspitools
==========

A collecion of my tools which I use with my various Raspberry Pi boards to make them work like I want. Because 
python (at least for me) is the standard programming language on the Raspberry Pi all these tools are written in python. Python also
has the advantage that it is already there when you set up your Raspi with a raspian operating system.

Logoutdialog
------------

Logoutdialog is a small python application to logout from the system or init a shutdown or reboot. When I changed 
my Raspberry PI to not use lxde any more and instead have openbox only I missed the logout dialog. I did not find a way 
to use the standard logout from lxde and so I wrote my own in python.
